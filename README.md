# CameraCounter
An internal web application designed to streamline logging of cameras manufactured and access to a daily report that contains important detail for managers.
This is designed to integrate in the employees daily routine to maximize efficiency (current way of logging is via pen-and-paper).
It also saves the managers' time, instead of physically collecting all paperworks, they can access all the reports in one screen.

## Essential Functions 
1. Allow employees to log cameras one by one to the database
2. Allow employees to log issues and failed cameras
3. Allow managers to set a daily target
4. Allow managers to see a daily report that includes all production orders done, all issues encountered and if targets are reached.

Wireframes and Prototype coming soon!
